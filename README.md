## Overview

Welcome to the Unsplash Mobile App! This app is built to provide a seamless experience for browsing, viewing, liking, and saving photos from the Unsplash website, all within a sleek and user-friendly interface. The app is developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and utilizes Observable Object for data binding and state management, without relying on the Combine framework.

## Features

1. **Browsing Photos**: Explore an extensive collection of high-quality, royalty-free photos from Unsplash. Scroll through the curated feed and discover stunning visuals from talented photographers worldwide.

2. **Photo Details**: Tap on a photo to view its details, including the photographer's name, photo resolution, number of likes, and user comments.

3. **Saving to Core Data**: If you come across a photo that you wish to save for later, simply add it to your favorites. The app uses Core Data to store and manage your liked photos.

4. **Authentication and Log In**: To access advanced features like liking and saving photos, users can log in or sign up securely using their Unsplash credentials.

## Technologies Used

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the MVVM pattern, separating data, business logic, and presentation layers for better code organization and maintainability.

- **Observable Object**: Observable Object is utilized to enable data binding and reactivity, updating UI elements whenever the underlying data changes.
